`ACEsuit` is a collection of Julia modules built around `ACE.jl` which provides a general and flexible implementation of the *Atomic Cluster Expansion* (ACE). ACE is an efficient approximation scheme for general permutation and isometry equi-variant functions. The focus of `ACEsuit` is on applications to modelling particle interactions. It provides constructions of symmetric polynomial bases. 

`ACE.jl` is currently being [rewritten](https://github.com/ACEsuit/ACE.jl) to account for a variety of generalisations. In the meantime `v0.8.x` provides a relatively [stable version](https://github.com/ACEsuit/ACE.jl/tree/dev-v0.8.x) which is limited to modelling interatomic potential interactions.
